Hello world

You're both wrong.

In a metaphorical sense this is both a new and old world.

So young, yet so many have died here.

Thousands of generations of humans.

Millions of generations of mammals.

Trillions upon trillions of generations all lived and died here.

But the earth is young.

The Dirt is still nutrient rich.

Life will continue to grow here.

And when life ends, this planet will have finally outgrown it's childish needs for company.

When we end, so does the planets childhood.
